An analysis of NHANES 2007-2008 Consumer Behavior Data

Research question:  Among a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States, to what extent is the time it takes to travel to the grocery store associated with the frequency of cooking dinner at home?

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a nationally representative, cross- sectional data set collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). NHANES data from 2007 and 2008 were pooled for this analysis. The sample is representative of the US civilian, non-institutionalized population. An average of 1.6 individuals are included from each household. To perform a complete case analysis, a sample population (n=2,437) was created that excluded individuals younger than 18 years old at the time of the interview, and any observations that had missing data for the exposure, outcome, or potential confounders. Because NHANES uses a complex weighted survey design, 2-year survey weights provided by NCHS were applied to the study sample.
